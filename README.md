# Fingerprint-Recognition

The Fingerprint Recognition project utilizes .tif image files to compare and calculate the percentage match between two fingerprints. This project employs the FLANN (Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors) matcher algorithm to efficiently find similarities between fingerprint features. It ultimately displays the percentage match, providing a reliable fingerprint recognition system for authentication or identification purposes.
